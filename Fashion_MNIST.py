#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++importing the data set of fashion mnist dataset++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#Fashion MNIST dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels)

fashion_mnist = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist

(train_images,train_labels),(test_images,test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

#print(fashion_mnist)

#Loading the dataset returns four NumPy arrays:
#The train_images and train_labels arrays are the training set—the data the model uses to learn.
#The model is tested against the test set, the test_images, and test_labels arrays.
#The images are 28x28 NumPy arrays, with pixel values ranging between 0 and 255. The labels are an array of integers, ranging from 0 to 9. These correspond to the #class of clothing the image represents:

#Label	Class
#0	T-shirt/top
#1	Trouser
#2	Pullover
#3	Dress
#4	Coat
#5	Sandal
#6	Shirt
#7	Sneaker
#8	Bag
#9	Ankle boot
#Each image is mapped to a single label. Since the class names are not included with the dataset, store them here to use later when plotting the images:

class_names = ['T-shirt/top', 'Trouser', 'Pullover', 'Dress', 'Coat', 
               'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle boot']

#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Compile the model++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#Before the model is ready for training, it needs a few more settings. These are added during the model's compile step:

#Loss function —This measures how accurate the model is during training. We want to minimize this function to "steer" the model in the right direction.
#Optimizer —This is how the model is updated based on the data it sees and its loss function.
#Metrics —Used to monitor the training and testing steps. The following example uses accuracy, the fraction of the images that are correctly classified.


model.compile(optimizer=tf.optimizers.Adam(), 
             loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
    #tf.train.AdamOptimizer() => tf.optimizers.Adam() *IMPORTANT*
#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Training model++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#Training the neural network model requires the following steps:

#Feed the training data to the model—in this example, the train_images and train_labels arrays.
#The model learns to associate images and labels.
#We ask the model to make predictions about a test set—in this example, the test_images array. We verify that the predictions match the labels from the test_labels array.
#To start training, call the model.fit method—the model is "fit" to the training data:


model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5) # here ephocs is like no of iterations


#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Evaluate accuracy+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#compare how the model performs on the test dataset:

test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)

print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)

 #The accuracy on the test dataset is a little less than the accuracy on the training dataset. This gap between training accuracy and test accuracy is an example of overfitting. Overfitting is when a machine learning model performs worse on new data than on their training data.
    
    
#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Make predictions++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#With the model trained, we can use it to make predictions about some images.

predictions = model.predict(test_images)

# The model has predicted the label for each image in the testing set. Let's take a look at the first prediction:

predictions[0]

# A prediction is an arraytest_labels[0] of 10 numbers. These describe the "confidence" of the model that the image corresponds to each of the 10 different articles of clothing. We can see which label has the highest confidence value in output.



np.argmax(predictions[0])

#The model is most confident that this image is an ankle boot, or class_names[9]. And we can check the test label to see this is correct:

test_labels[0]
